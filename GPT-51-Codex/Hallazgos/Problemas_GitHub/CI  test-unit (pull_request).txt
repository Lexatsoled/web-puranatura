Root cause

All tests failed with: Error: Cannot find module '@testing-library/dom' — the test suite imports that package but it is not listed/installed in the repository's devDependencies.
Quick fix (recommended)

Add @testing-library/dom to devDependencies in the repository root package.json.
Commit the change and make sure the CI job installs devDependencies (npm ci / npm install without --production).
Re-run the CI build.
Exact change to make

Edit package.json (root) at: https://github.com/Lexatsoled/web-puranatura/blob/8990890edcdb086925a002b7905d201660599978/package.json
Add this entry under "devDependencies" (choose a matching/latest semver; the example uses a stable current range):

"@testing-library/dom": "^8.0.0"

Example snippet (showing context — insert inside devDependencies): { ... "devDependencies": { "@axe-core/react": "^4.11.0", "@playwright/test": "^1.56.1", ... "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.9.1", "@testing-library/react": "^16.3.0", "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.6.1", "@testing-library/dom": "^8.0.0", ... } ... }

Commands to run locally / in CI

Locally (or as part of CI if you prefer to only modify lockfile via install): npm install --save-dev @testing-library/dom

If you update package.json manually, update lockfile and node_modules: npm ci

CI checklist

Ensure the CI workflow installs devDependencies. If your CI uses npm ci, it will install devDependencies by default — but confirm it's not passing --production or setting NODE_ENV=production before install.
If you use caching for node_modules or the package manager cache, invalidate the cache key or bump it so the new package gets fetched.
Alternative (if you intentionally removed the package)

If tests can be changed to avoid directly importing '@testing-library/dom', replace direct imports with equivalents from '@testing-library/react' or adjust test setup. But adding the package is the simplest and least disruptive fix.
Why this will resolve the failure

Tests import functionality that lives in @testing-library/dom; installing it will satisfy the require/import and allow Vitest to load tests instead of failing immediately at module resolution.
If you want, I can:

Provide a commit patch you can apply that updates package.json and package-lock (or yarn/pnpm lock) and show the exact diff.
