GitHub Copilot Chat Assistant — Root cause and fix:

Root cause

The job failed because the runner automatically rejects workflows that use the deprecated actions/upload-artifact@v3. The job log shows: "This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of actions/upload-artifact: v3."
Fix

Update every uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3 to the supported v4 release.
Quick patch (replace both occurrences in .github/workflows/playwright.yml)

Replace: uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
With: uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4

Notes and recommendations

Use actions/upload-artifact@v4 (the current maintained major) or pin to a full tag/sha if you prefer stricter immutability.
Search the repo for any other references to upload-artifact@v3 (git grep "upload-artifact@v3") and update them too.
After committing the change, re-run the workflow. The "Prepare all required actions" step should no longer fail due to the deprecated action.
If you want, add a CI-only check: run a quick branch push or use workflow_dispatch to validate the change.
