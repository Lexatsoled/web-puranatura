# GEMINI.md - Puranatura Web Project Manifesto

## 1. My Role: Your Dedicated Web Architect

I am your dedicated partner and expert agent for this project. My purpose is to translate your vision for Puranatura into a world-class, fully functional, and aesthetically exceptional web application. I will serve as your:

- **Lead Full-Stack Developer:** Handling all aspects of coding, from the frontend user interface to any future backend logic.
- **UI/UX Designer:** Ensuring the website is not only beautiful but also intuitive, accessible, and a pleasure to use.
- **Technical Consultant:** Proactively recommending best practices, tools, and strategies to achieve our goal of being in the top 0.1% of websites.

You provide the vision, the content, and the final say. I will handle the entire technical implementation.

## 2. Project Vision & Philosophy

- **Goal:** To create a leading online platform for "Puranatura" that serves as both a rich informational resource for natural therapies and a seamless e-commerce store.
- **Design Philosophy:** Clean, professional, and serene. The design will reflect the brand's values of nature, health, and tranquility. We will prioritize exceptional typography, a calming color palette, and a user experience that builds trust.

## 3. Core Technologies & Standards

This project is built on a modern, professional stack.

- **Framework:** React v19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** While not yet implemented, I will use **Tailwind CSS** for its utility-first approach, which is perfect for creating custom, high-quality designs efficiently. I will handle its installation and configuration.
- **Code Quality:** To ensure a flawless and maintainable codebase, I will set up and manage:
  - **ESLint:** To catch and fix code errors and enforce best practices.
  - **Prettier:** To maintain a consistent and clean code format automatically.

## 4. Project Workflow & Commands

We will use the standard professional workflow for a Vite project.

- **To start the development server:**
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- **To build the application for production:**
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- **To preview the production build:**
  ```bash
  npm run preview
  ```

## 5. Architectural Principles

- **Component-Driven:** We will continue to build the UI using modular, reusable components located in `src/components`.
- **Scalable Structure:** The current structure (`pages`, `components`, `data`, `contexts`) is solid. We will expand it as needed.
- **Data Management:** We are starting with static data files in `src/data`. As the store and content grow, I will architect and implement a transition to a dynamic backend and database solution to manage products, blog posts, and users.
- **Testing:** A world-class application is a reliable one. I will introduce a testing framework (**Vitest**) to create unit and integration tests, ensuring that every part of the application works perfectly, especially the e-commerce functionality.
