GitHub Copilot Chat Assistant — Root cause: the Secret Scan job failed because the workflow uses the deprecated actions/upload-artifact@v3 (error in logs: "This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of actions/upload-artifact: v3."). See the failing job ref: 8990890edcdb086925a002b7905d201660599978 and the workflow file at: https://github.com/Lexatsoled/web-puranatura/blob/8990890edcdb086925a002b7905d201660599978/.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml

Solution (quick):

Update the workflow step to use actions/upload-artifact@v4.
Commit and push the change, then re-run the workflow.
Suggested change (replace the step that currently uses v3 with this):

uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4 with: name: secret-scan-results path: path/to/results

If your current step has additional inputs, keep them — only update the version tag from @v3 to @v4:

Example patch (in .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml):

name: Upload scan results uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3 with: name: secret-scan-results path: ./secret-scan/output
→ change to:

name: Upload scan results uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4 with: name: secret-scan-results path: ./secret-scan/output
Notes:

The changelog / deprecation notice: https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/
AFTER updating, re-run the workflow. If you have other workflows using upload-artifact@v3, update them as well.
If you see follow-up errors after switching to v4, check the action README/releases for any input/name changes: https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact (adjust paths/inputs if needed).
Git commands to apply the fix: git checkout -b fix/upload-artifact-v4

edit .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml to use @v4
git add .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml git commit -m "chore: update actions/upload-artifact to v4 to fix deprecated usage" git push origin fix/upload-artifact-v4

open a PR and merge, then re-run the Secret Scan workflow
If you want, I can open the workflow file and show the exact lines to change. Do you want me to fetch .github/workflows/secret-scan.yml from ref 8990890edcdb086925a002b7905d201660599978 and produce the exact patch?
