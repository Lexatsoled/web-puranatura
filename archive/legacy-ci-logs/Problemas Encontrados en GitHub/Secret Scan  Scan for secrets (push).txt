Cause

The run failed during workflow preparation because the workflow uses a deprecated version of actions/upload-artifact (v3). GitHub is blocking that version: "This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of actions/upload-artifact: v3."
Fix

Update the upload-artifact action to a supported release (v4). After the change the workflow will no longer be blocked at setup and the Upload results step will execute as expected.

Optional recommendations

If you want the artifact uploaded even when a preceding step aborted the job early (rare), change the condition to if: always(). Keep in mind that always() will run even when the job succeeds:
if you want artifacts only on failure, keep if: failure().
Scan other workflows for deprecated action versions (search for @v1/@v2/@v3 of GitHub-provided actions) and update to the current major (e.g., actions/upload-artifact@v4).
After updating, push the change and re-run the workflow. If the job still fails, attach the new job logs so we can inspect the next error.
