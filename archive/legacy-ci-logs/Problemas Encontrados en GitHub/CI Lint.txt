Summary of failure

CI job 55539339483 failed because ESLint found 127 problems (120 errors). The failure log (ref: 8990890edcdb086925a002b7905d201660599978) shows many common patterns: unused variables/params, assigned-but-unused variables, Unexpected any, empty blocks, case-declaration errors, unnecessary escape characters and unused eslint-disable directives. Example: lighthouse-runner.mjs shows an unused catch parameter at line 88:16 (see file at ref 8990890edcdb086925a002b7905d201660599978).
Recommended fix plan (high-impact, ordered)

Run automatic fixes first (safe & quick)

Locally or in CI run: npx eslint --ext .js,.ts,.tsx . --fix
This will resolve a subset (log states 4 errors fixable automatically) and reduce noise.
Address the top recurring lint categories (manual edits)

Unused variables / params: remove them, use underscore prefix, or use empty-catch binding.
Assigned but never used: either use the variable or remove the assignment.
Unexpected any: replace any with a concrete type or unknown and narrow it.
Empty blocks: either add a comment explaining intentional noop or remove the block; use eslint-disable only when justified.
no-case-declarations: wrap declarations inside blocks for switch cases.
no-useless-escape: remove unnecessary backslashes in regex/strings.
Remove unused eslint-disable lines that are no longer needed.
Re-run lint and tests; repeat until green.

Concrete code suggestions (copy-paste edits)

Fix the unused catch parameter in lighthouse-runner.mjs (current file at ref 8990890edcdb086925a002b7905d201660599978) Current snippet (lines ~84–90): try { await chrome.kill(); } catch (e) { // Chrome ya cerrado }

Two safe fixes (choose one):

Option A — use empty catch binding (no unused var): try { await chrome.kill(); } catch { // Chrome already closed }

Option B — keep error but mark intentionally unused (underscore name): try { await chrome.kill(); } catch (_e) { // Chrome already closed }

Note: Option A is the cleanest if you don't need the error object and your Node target supports it.

Handle unused function parameters like catch (e) in other JS files Replace catch (e) { /* noop / } with catch { / noop / } or catch (_e) { / noop */ }.

Replace intentionally unused parameters with a leading underscore Example for event handlers or callbacks: // Before function onClick(e) { // nothing done with e }

// After function onClick(_e) { // intentionally unused parameter }

ESLint configs commonly ignore names starting with _.

Fix "assigned a value but never used" If the variable was intended to be used later, use it; otherwise remove the assignment: // Before const addToCartInterval = setInterval(() => { ... }, 1000);

// If you don't need to clear it: setInterval(() => { ... }, 1000);

// If you intended to clear it later, ensure clearInterval(addToCartInterval) is present.

Replace any with unknown or specific types (TypeScript files) // Before function normalize(x: any) { ... }

// After (if you know the shape) interface Input { foo: string; bar?: number } function normalize(x: Input) { ... }

// Or if type truly unknown: function normalize(x: unknown) { if (typeof x === 'string') { ... } }

Fix empty block warnings (no-empty) // Before try { } catch (err) {}

// After (document intent) try { // intentionally empty: operation is fire-and-forget } catch (err) { // handle if needed } Or: catch (err) { // eslint-disable-next-line no-empty }

Fix no-case-declarations // Before switch (v) { case 'a': const x = 1; // error: lexical declaration in case break; }

// After switch (v) { case 'a': { const x = 1; break; } }

Remove unused eslint-disable directives Search for lines like /* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any */ that are not needed and delete them. They trigger "Unused eslint-disable directive" errors.

Fix no-useless-escape (remove backslash) Example error at a regex or string — remove unnecessary backslashes: // Before const re = /https://example.com/;

// If escaping isn't necessary in that context, remove the backslash before '.' only if not required. Validate the intended regex before changing.

Quick commands to reproduce & iterate

Reproduce locally (checkout the failing commit ref): git fetch && git checkout 8990890edcdb086925a002b7905d201660599978
Run lint and auto-fix: npx eslint --ext .js,.ts,.tsx . --fix
Run full lint to see remaining errors: npx eslint --ext .js,.ts,.tsx .
Suggested CI improvements (optional)

Add eslint --fix as a pre-commit step or run it in a separate job to reduce noise.
If some test/tooling files legitimately require different rules, consider adding targeted eslint overrides in .eslintrc (not a global rule relaxation). For example, allow leading underscore for unused args with argsIgnorePattern: '^_'.
Do not relax core rules broadly; prefer code fixes.
Priority file edits to unblock CI quickly

Fix all unused-catcher occurrences (many files show 'e' is defined but never used). Search for "catch (e)" and change to catch { } or catch (_e) as appropriate.
Address assigned-but-unused variables in tests/tools (these are quick to remove).
Fix a few Unexpected any locations in tests or setup files by changing type any -> unknown or a more precise type where obvious.

Example file with one of the errors: lighthouse-runner.mjs at ref 8990890edcdb086925a002b7905d201660599978 (edit around the finally catch to remove unused parameter).
If you want, I can: (A) produce a focused patch for the highest-frequency errors (unused catch params + assigned-but-unused variables) and show a diff for the commit ref, or (B) run through one representative file at a time and provide exact edits. Which do you prefer?
